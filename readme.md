# This repo contains solution of the ECE657A Data Knowledge and Modelling Analysis's First assignment

## In the assignment we had to analyse the iris dataset and apply differnet classifiers the solutions are in the Python Notebook.

In the first assignment we had the iris dataset and we had to first analyse the dataset and after that we had to apply different classifiers.

I have applied KNN, SVM and tree based classifiers and then I also explained the outcome of each classifier and other questions asked in the assignment.
